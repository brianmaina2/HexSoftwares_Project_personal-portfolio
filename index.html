    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Brian, a dedicated software developer and front-end engineer, having honed my skills at Moringa School. My technical expertise spans Ruby on Rails, SQL, JSON, React.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, gained through comprehensive training in both back-end and front-end technologies. This versatile foundation has equipped me with a solid understanding of software engineering, complemented by essential soft skills such as agility, adaptability, communication, and collaboration. My experience at Moringa School has prepared me to thrive as a full-stack developer and tackle real-world challenges in the software development industry.
      
      Beyond coding, I am deeply committed to social change through my work with the LightsCare Foundation. Driven by a passion to empower underprivileged families, I focus on delivering impactful initiatives that foster community development and environmental stewardship. I believe every individual deserves an opportunity to shine, and I actively engage with communities to understand their needs, creating sustainable solutions for a brighter future.</p>
